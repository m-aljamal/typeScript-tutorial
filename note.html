basic: 
    create app.ts and add code to it and then compilet with tsc app.ts  will genreate new app.js file 
    


Types: 
    const num1 = 20;   no need to tell typeScript this is a number const num1: number  = 20; it will
    autmaticly know that but use need to declear the type if you don't but value 
    const x1: number 
    x1 = 5 

    number 
    string 
    boolean 
    object: 
        const person: {} = {      or const person : object = { } but that not specific
               name: "Mohammad",
             age: 32,
            };
       
             console.log(person);
        
        to be more specific: 
              const person: {
                 name: string;
                 age: number;
               } = {
                name: "Mohammad",
                age: 32,
              };
          
             console.log(person);
           
    array:  type can be flexcable or strict 
            flexcable : any[]  any value in could be in array
            strict    : string[]

    tuple   [1,2]    this not normal array this is fixed-length array 
            role: [number, string]  the role is role[0] number and role[1] string 
            you need array with only 2 elements and one is number and secound is string 

    enum    it is enumerated global constant 
            enum UserRole { // typeScript enum type
             ADMIN, //0    can custom with any number like ADMIN = 5    will be 5  or can be with text ADMIN = 'ADMIN'
             READ_ONLY, // 1
             AUTHOR, // 2
            }
         
     any   any value you want 

    union  acceept two deferent types of value  input1: number | string | boolean 
           +number convert string to number 


           Type Aliases:  type Combinable = number | string   reuse when need it in the code
           so no need to type number | string just Combinable 
           
           can also store object types: 
                    type User = {name: string; age: number}
                    const u1: User = {name: "Max", age: 30}


     function return value: 
            function add(n1: number, n2: number) :number {
             return n1 + n2;
             }
      by puting :number that tell this function will return number value
      but it is good to let typeScritp autmaticly return the type it will know the return will be number 

      : void    will not retrun anything 
      
      : Function    but this will be any function 

      functions types:  describe function parameters and return value 

                function add(n1: number, n2: number): number {
                 return n1 + n2;
                }
                                        parameters       return value
                let combineValue: (a: number, b: number) => number;    


    unknown:  we don't know what the user will put here it number or string 
              we can story any value 
    
    never:   will not return any thing never not like void will return undefined which is a value
